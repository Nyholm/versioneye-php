##Installation

first you have to decide which `http adapter` to use. The library supports `guzzlehttp/guzzle` and `kriswallsmith/buzz`. Where guzzle is default.


```
$ composer require "guzzlehttp/guzzle" ~4 //or
$ composer require "kriswallsmith/buzz" ~0.10

$ composer require "digitalkaoz/versioneye-php" *
```

##Usage

all API endpoints are implemented, see https://www.versioneye.com/api/v2/swagger_doc.json for their detailed docs.


### programmatic:

```php
<?php

use Rs\VersionEye\Client;

$api = (new Client())->api('services'); // Rs\VersionEye\Api\Services
$api->ping(); //array

//other implemented APIs
$api = (new Client())->api('github'); // Rs\VersionEye\Api\Github
$api = (new Client())->api('me'); // Rs\VersionEye\Api\Me
$api = (new Client())->api('products'); // Rs\VersionEye\Api\Products
$api = (new Client())->api('sessions'); // Rs\VersionEye\Api\Sessions
$api = (new Client())->api('users'); // Rs\VersionEye\Api\Users

```

### cli:

```
$ bin/versioneye services:ping
$ bin/versioneye products:search symfony
```

##Configuration

to store your generated API Token globally you can create a global config file in your home directory:

`~/.veye.rc` we share the same config file with the ruby cli https://github.com/versioneye/veye

the file would look like:

```rc
:api_key: YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

now you dont have to pass your token on each call!


##CLI Tool

to build a standalone phar, simply execute the following commands.

```
$ vendor/bin/box build
$ php versioneye-php.phar
```

## Commands:

The Commands are autogenerated by introspecting the API Implementations. Each Public Method is a Command, each Method Parameter will be translated into a InputArgument or InputOption.
